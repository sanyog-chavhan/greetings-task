# Description - 
  User Greetings shows user IP Address and Country Location. The Project is based on Django Framework and Python Language. The User interface is made using
  simple HTML and CSS. The Library used for the same is geoIP2. For deployment I've used ngrok, which is a cross platform application which exposes local server
  ports to the Internet.
  
The Project is in Master branch.
